Generate a complete, production-ready Android APK that embodies the Verum Omnis constitutional framework, implements all nine brains with mathematical precision, provides cryptographically sealed forensic reports, and operates entirely offline on Android devices. The result must be professional, court-admissible, and accessible to ordinary citizens seeking justice.

This is not a prototype. This is the foundation of global access to forensic truth.

Build it with excellence. 🌐⚖️🔒
